# Generate Thumbnail in NodeJS

- In this NodeJS script we are generating a thumbnail for a video.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> We have to download the WHOLE freaking file to generate the thumbnail! TBH IDK if there us a more performant way of doing this.

## How to Run it Locally

1. `cd docs/gen-thumbnail-in-nodejs-and-minio/`.
2. `pnpm i --frozen-lockfile`.
3. Copy a video file named `file.mp4` next to `index.ts`.
4. Run `pnpm test`.
